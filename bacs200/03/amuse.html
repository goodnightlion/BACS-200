    <h1>What I Enjoy</h1>
    <p>by Jamal Blassingale</p>

    <p>Here are some links to websites that make me feel all sorts of ways. Hopefully they fill you with as much entertainment as they do for me!</p>
    

    <h2>Lofi</h2>
    <p>This is a link to chill beats to study to. I enjoy listening to lofi whenever I study because the songs consist of a smooth beat backed by bass and a calm melody.</p>

    <h2>The Awesomer</h2>
    <p>This unique website was introduced to me by one of my best friends in highschool. Every day you can find something new on it's homepage, so go check it out!</p>

    <h2>The Racial Dot Map</h2>
    <p>This site is an interactive map of the United States that shows the demographic population based off census data from 2010. It is fascinating and extremely educational to be able to visualize the effects of modern segregation in our communities today.</p>
