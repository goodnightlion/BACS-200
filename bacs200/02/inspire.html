        <p> I am inspired by many things. Throughout my journey called life, I have looked up to many people who have all had some sort of significant contribution to the development of who I am today. These can be firends and family I have grown close to or even celeberties that insipire me to be a better version of myself. Miguel for example is the full package; he has the looks, talent, and swagger that I aspire to have someday soon. </p>
        <p>
            Here are some traits to look for in heros of mine:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Someone who is innovative. Not nessesarily by inventing the newest technology but, someone who isn't afraid of breaking away from the status quo.</li>
            <li>They need to care about their community and realize that their actions can help or hurt others.</li>
            <li>They have to love what they do and encourage others to find their passion and do everything they can to pursue this.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Miguel was inspired at an early age by the influences of R&B, funk, jazz, hip hop, and classic rock. His parents divorced when he was only eight years old. These facts align closely with my younger years as these are some of the major generes I was exposed to and my parents were actually never married.
