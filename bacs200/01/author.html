    <h1>About the Author</h1>

    <p>My name is Jamal Blassingale and I am a business marketing major with a minor in entrepreneurship and digital marketing at the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley, Colorado.

I am a desk assistant and student manager of the Monfort College of Business Entrepreneurial Challenge during the week and a member of the Blue Knights Percussion Ensemble by the weekend. I am committed to my education and excited to apply my knowledge from the classroom to the real world of business.

I am currently working on the development of a small clothing business and plan on continuing this project for the next few years while I begin my journey searching for an employer after graduation.</p>
