        <p> I am inspired by many things. Throughout my journey in life, I have met many people who have a significant contribution to the development of who I am today. </p>
        <p>
            The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Outrageously courageous - they disturb the status quo and define a new normal</li>
            <li>Motivate others - people follow a great leader</li>
            <li>Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world</li>
            <li>Sacrifice & commitment - their impact usually costs them everything</li>
            <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Over the last 100 years no man exemplifies these values for me more than
            Martin Luther King.  He called people to be accountable for the racial
            prejudices that we all carry.   He demonstrated that violence is not the
            best way to create lasting change. And throughout his life he sacrificed
            everything to make the world better.
